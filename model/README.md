# Model

This directory contains the code of our discrete-time queueing model of the decentralized autoscaler. The actual model
is implemented in the `autoscaling_model` directory. It contains the executable R scripts used to produce the results in
the paper's sections 4 and 6.2. The `R` directory contains helper functions.
